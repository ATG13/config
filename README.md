## dotfiles essentially

This repo has most of the dotfiles I use for my config. It does not have the exact copy of my system, it is more like an inspiration template.

Almost all the dotfies are taken from someone else, if I have their links I will attach them.

*To-Do*: 
- Add a youtube video displaying my gnome config on ubuntu.
- Add the gnome-extension files
